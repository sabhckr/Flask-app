## ðŸ“ˆ CI/CD

- GitHub Actions builds and tests the app automatically.  
- Can be extended to deploy to cloud automatically.

## ðŸ“š Notes

- This repo is meant to show **DevOps skills**, not just Flask coding.  
- You can extend it by adding cloud deployment, IaC, monitoring, and logging.

### Usage:

1. Save as `create-readme.sh` in your repo root.
2. Run:

`create-readme.sh`

âœ… It will create the **complete, professional README** in one step.

If you want, I can also **add a tiny GitHub Actions snippet** at the end of this same script to **automatically push README changes** to the repoâ€”still in the same one-bash approach.

Do you want me to do that?
