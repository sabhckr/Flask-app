📚 Notes
This repo demonstrates DevOps skills, not just application coding

Extendable with cloud deployment, Infrastructure as Code, monitoring, and logging

Models are downloaded on first use and stored persistently

🔧 Troubleshooting
Port 3000 already in use?
Change the port mapping in docker-compose.yml from "3000:8080" to "3001:8080"

Out of disk space?
Models can be large (several GB). Ensure you have adequate storage.

WebUI not loading?
Wait longer for initial setup, then check logs: docker compose logs open-webui
